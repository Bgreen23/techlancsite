        <p class="code-p">The Lancaster tech community expects that activities, events, and digital forums:</p>
        <ol class="code-p">
          <li class="code-li">
            Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
          </li>
          <li class="code-li">
            Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
          </li>
          <li class="code-li">
            Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.

          <li class="code-li">
            Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
          </li>
          <li class="code-li">
            Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.

            Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.
          </li>
          <li class="code-li">
            Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
          </li>
          <li class="code-li">
            Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
