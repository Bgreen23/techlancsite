        <h2>Code of Ethics <span>/</span> Conduct </h2>
        <p>The Lancaster tech community expects that activities, events, and digital forums:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members and participating organizations remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.
          </li>
        </ol>
