    <h2>TechLancaster started as a simple local meetup, a safe place for like-minded tech people to come together and geek out.</h2>
    <p>We've strived to be open, welcoming, and supportive to everyone in the community, regardless of their interest or background.</p>
    <p>The past year has seen amazing growth in Lancaster's tech scene, and we believe this is only the beginning. As members of the tech community, we want to support this growth and ensure the community remains a healthy, open, and welcoming place for all its current and future members.</p>

<h2>Code of Ethics <span>/</span> Conduct </h2>

Code of Ethics / Conduct

The Lancaster tech community expects that activities, events, and digital forums:

1. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
2. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
3. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
4. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
5. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
6. Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use.
7. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.
8. Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
9. Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
10. Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members and participating organizations remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
11. Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.

The Lancaster tech community reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in activities, events, and digital forums.
